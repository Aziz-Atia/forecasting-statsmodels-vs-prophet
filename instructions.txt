Project Description:
This project explores time series forecasting techniques using statsmodels (ARIMA model) and Facebook's Prophet, incorporating corrections to ensure model accuracy as outlined in a KDnuggets tutorial.

Instructions-
Data Setup:

Download the dc.csv dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Google Colab for analysis.
Library Installation and Import:

Install the necessary libraries, including Prophet, in Colab using the appropriate command.
Time Series Modeling:

Implement the ARIMA model specifically on the close_USD column from the dataset.
Adjust the installation method for Prophet to match the Colab environment.
Evaluation Metrics:

Use mean_absolute_error and mean_squared_error from sklearn to evaluate the model, focusing on the close_USD column for accurate comparisons.
Reference:

The implementation follows guidelines from the KDnuggets article on time series forecasting with Statsmodels and Prophet.
